# Helmet Node.js Example


This is a simple Node.js application using **Helmet** for securing HTTP headers.

## Features

- **Express**: Web framework for building the application.
- **Helmet**: Helps secure the application by setting various HTTP headers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/muchhalsagar/helmet-node-app.git
   cd helmet-node-app

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install


### Running the Application

  You can run the application with the following command:
  
    npm start

  This will start the application using ts-node and the app will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.


## Access the Application

Once the server is running, visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser. You should see:

```bash
Hello, secure world!
```

This confirms that Helmet is working to secure your HTTP headers.
